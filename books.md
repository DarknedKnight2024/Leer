### The Fall of the House of Usher

- **Author**: Edgar Allan Poe _(1809 - 1849)_
- **Published**: September 13, 1839
- **Genres**
  - Fiction
  - Gothic Horror
  - Psychological fiction
  - Supernatural fiction
- **Characters**
  1. **The Narrator**: An unnamed childhood friend of Roderick, he serves as the observational lens through which the reader experiences the tale. His detached yet increasingly unsettled perspective underscores the eerie atmosphere and heightens tension as events unfold.
  2. **Roderick Usher**: The most central character, he is the hypersensitive, mentally ill owner of the House of Usher. His declining state—attributed to the house’s "influence" and his family’s cursed legacy—drives the narrative, as his paranoia and fear of Madeline’s return escalate the horror.
  3. **Madeline Usher**: Roderick’s twin sister, her apparent death (and later grotesque reappearance) is the critical catalyst for the story’s climax. Her enigmatic presence, even when believed entombed, symbolizes the decay of the Usher lineage and the house’s malevolence.
- **Setting**: A remote, decaying mansion (House of Usher) in a gloomy, mist-shrouded countryside, presumably in Europe (though specifics are vague).
- **Description**: "The Fall of the House of Usher" is a classic Gothic short story by Edgar Allan Poe, first published in 1839, that masterfully weaves psychological horror, isolation, and supernatural dread. Set in a remote, decaying mansion in a gloomy, mist-shrouded landscape, the tale follows a nameless narrator visiting his childhood friend Roderick Usher, who suffers from a mysterious mental illness exacerbated by his family’s cursed legacy and the oppressive atmosphere of the house itself. Roderick’s twin sister Madeline, believed dead and entombed beneath the house, later returns in a grotesque, half-alive state, triggering a violent unraveling of the Usher family’s sanity and the physical collapse of their decrepit home—a symbolic reflection of the decay of both the lineage and the mind. Poe’s vivid descriptions and focus on eerie, claustrophobic tension cement this as a quintessential example of Gothic literature, exploring themes of doom, hereditary madness, and the blurring of reality and the supernatural.

### The Great Gatsby

- **Published**: April 10, 1925
- **Genres**
  - Literary Fiction
  - Jazz Age Novel
  - Social Realism
  - Modernist Fiction

- **Characters**
  1. **Nick Carraway**: The first-person narrator, a Midwestern transplant to New York; serves as an observer and moral anchor, bridging Gatsby’s world and the Buchanans’.
  2. **Jay Gatsby**: Enigmatic millionaire host of lavish parties; driven by his obsession to reunite with Daisy Buchanan, his lost love.
  3. **Daisy Buchanan**: Wealthy socialite, Gatsby’s former lover, and Nick’s cousin; embodies the superficiality of "old money" and the tragedy of unfulfilled dreams.
  4. **Tom Buchanan**: Daisy’s husband, a brute with "old money" status; represents the entrenched privilege and moral decadence of the elite.
  5. **Jordan Baker**: Daisy’s friend and professional golfer; a cynical, independent woman who challenges societal norms but remains complicit in the upper class’s excess.
  6. **George Wilson**: Poor garage owner and husband of Myrtle; a tragic figure caught in the crossfire of the wealthy’s recklessness.
  7. **Myrtle Wilson**: Tom’s mistress, ambitious and materialistic; her death catalyzes the story’s downfall.
- **Setting**: Primarily set in the summer of 1922, in the fictional towns of West Egg and East Egg on Long Island, New York. West Egg is home to "new money" elites (like Gatsby), while East Egg houses "old money" aristocrats (the Buchanans). Key locations also include New York City (for parties and urban excess) and the desolate Valley of Ashes (symbolizing moral decay).
- **Description**: A seminal work of American literature, "The Great Gatsby" critiques the hollow materialism and moral emptiness of the Jazz Age. Narrated by Nick, the story follows Gatsby’s relentless pursuit of Daisy, a symbol of his idealized past and the "American Dream." Through opulent parties, forbidden love, and fatal collisions, Fitzgerald explores themes of illusion vs. reality, the corruption of wealth, and the impossibility of recapturing the past. The green light at Daisy’s dock, Gatsby’s iconic symbol of hope, underscores the novel’s meditation on longing and disillusionment.

  - Gothic Horror
  - Philosophical Fiction
  - Epistolary Novel
  - Science Fiction
- **Characters**
  1. **Victor Frankenstein**: The tragic protagonist, a brilliant but arrogant scientist who creates a humanoid creature from stitched-together body parts. His guilt and fear drive the narrative, leading to the destruction of his loved ones.
  2. **The Creature**: Victor’s unnamed, grotesque creation, driven to vengeance after enduring rejection and isolation by society. His intelligence and emotional depth challenge perceptions of "monstrosity."
  3. **Robert Walton**: A Arctic explorer who discovers Victor’s story through his letters; serves as a frame narrator, connecting Victor’s tale to the larger narrative.
  4. **Elizabeth Lavenza**: Victor’s adoptive cousin and later wife; symbolizes innocence and the personal cost of Victor’s obsession.
  5. **Henry Clerval**: Victor’s loyal friend and fellow student; represents pure friendship and contrasts with Victor’s destructive ambition.
  6. **Alphonse Frankenstein**: Victor’s father, a compassionate and wise man who supports Victor but cannot shield him from his fate.

- **Setting**: Primarily set in late 18th/early 19th-century Europe, with key locations including Geneva (Switzerland), Ingolstadt (Germany), the Swiss Alps, and the Arctic seas. The story unfolds across multiple timelines, framed by Robert Walton’s voyage to the North Pole.
- **Description**: A landmark of Gothic literature, Frankenstein is a cautionary tale about unchecked scientific ambition and the consequences of rejecting responsibility for one’s creation. Narrated through layered epistolary accounts (Walton’s letters, Victor’s journal, and the creature’s own narrative), the novel explores themes of isolation, identity, and the ethics of "playing God." Victor’s descent into paranoia and the creature’s haunting quest for companionship drive a tragic narrative that critiques both human arrogance and societal cruelty. Often interpreted as a meditation on humanity, it remains a cornerstone of horror and philosophical fiction.
