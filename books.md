### To Kill a Mockingbird

- **Author**: Harper Lee _(1926–2016)_
- **Published**: September 1839
- **Genres**
  - Fiction
  - Gothic Horror
  - Psychological fiction
  - Supernatural fiction
- **Characters**
  1. **The Narrator**: An unnamed childhood friend of Roderick, he serves as the observational lens through which the reader experiences the tale. His detached yet increasingly unsettled perspective underscores the eerie atmosphere and heightens tension as events unfold.
  2. **Roderick Usher**: The most central character, he is the hypersensitive, mentally ill owner of the House of Usher. His declining state—attributed to the house’s "influence" and his family’s cursed legacy—drives the narrative, as his paranoia and fear of Madeline’s return escalate the horror.
  3. **Madeline Usher**: Roderick’s twin sister, her apparent death (and later grotesque reappearance) is the critical catalyst for the story’s climax. Her enigmatic presence, even when believed entombed, symbolizes the decay of the Usher lineage and the house’s malevolence.
- **Setting**: A remote, decaying mansion (House of Usher) in a gloomy, mist-shrouded countryside, presumably in Europe (though specifics are vague).
- **Description**: "The Fall of the House of Usher" is a classic Gothic short story by Edgar Allan Poe, first published in 1839, that masterfully weaves psychological horror, isolation, and supernatural dread. Set in a remote, decaying mansion in a gloomy, mist-shrouded landscape, the tale follows a nameless narrator visiting his childhood friend Roderick Usher, who suffers from a mysterious mental illness exacerbated by his family’s cursed legacy and the oppressive atmosphere of the house itself. Roderick’s twin sister Madeline, believed dead and entombed beneath the house, later returns in a grotesque, half-alive state, triggering a violent unraveling of the Usher family’s sanity and the physical collapse of their decrepit home—a symbolic reflection of the decay of both the lineage and the mind. Poe’s vivid descriptions and focus on eerie, claustrophobic tension cement this as a quintessential example of Gothic literature, exploring themes of doom, hereditary madness, and the blurring of reality and the supernatural.
