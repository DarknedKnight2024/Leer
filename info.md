#### The Fall of the House of Usher
- **Author**: Edgar Allan Poe
- **Genre**: &#008000;Gothic
  1. **The Narrator:** An unnamed childhood friend of Roderick, he serves as the observational lens through which the reader experiences the tale. His detached yet increasingly unsettled perspective underscores the eerie atmosphere and heightens tension as events unfold.
  2. **Roderick Usher:** The most central character, he is the hypersensitive, mentally ill owner of the House of Usher. His declining state—attributed to the house’s "influence" and his family’s cursed legacy—drives the narrative, as his paranoia and fear of Madeline’s return escalate the horror.
  3. **Madeline Usher:** Roderick’s twin sister, her apparent death (and later grotesque reappearance) is the critical catalyst for the story’s climax. Her enigmatic presence, even when believed entombed, symbolizes the decay of the Usher lineage and the house’s malevolence.
